# Evaluation Plan

## Fig.8

- Experiment

	{ctrl, onboard} x {MPTCP, M3-bare, M3} x {512k, 2m, 10m, 100s}

- Data Processing For Controlled Experiment

	* Input: mperf log, HSR Trace

	* Output: avg. bandwidth utilization on each trace

- Data Processing For Onboard Experiment

	* Input: mperf log

	* Output: avg. throughput on each trace

## Fig.9(a)

- Experiment

	{ctrl, onboard} x {MPTCP, M3-bare, M3} x 100s

- Data Processing

	* Input: PCAP

	* Output: thp, RTT(time series per trace)

## Fig.9(b)

- Experiment

	{ctrl, onboard} x {M3-bare, M3} x 100s

- Data Processing

	* Input: PCAP, time difference on relay & proxy, time interval of events

	* Output: delivery delay(time when data can be delivered to user - time when sent) for each packet during each event

- Additional Data Processing For Onboard Version

	computing time difference on relay & proxy(TBD)

## Fig.10(a)

- Experiment

	{ctrl, onboard} x {M3-bare, M3-QoE, M3} x 100s surge

- Data Processing

	* Input: surge log

	* Output: download time for each page

## Fig.10(b)

- Experiment

	{ctrl, onboard} x {M3-bare, M3-QoE, M3} x 100s surge

- Data Processing

	* Input: PCAP, target data size

	* Output: download time for first (target data size) bytes of each page

## Fig.11

- Experiment

	ctrl x {M3-bare, M3-QoE, M3} x same page requests

- Data Processing

	* Input: surge log

	* Output: download time for each page

## Fig.12

- Experiment

	ctrl x M3 x priorized flow with normal bg flows

- Data Processing

	* Input: PCAP, HSR trace

	* Output: time series of throughput and aggragated bw

## Fig.13(b)

- Experiment

	ctrl x M3 x {3 ifs, 6 ifs, 9 ifs} x same page requests
	
- Data Processing

	* Input: surge log, time threshold

	* Output: satisfied users#(page download time <= time threshold)
